            <img src = "Pinboard.png" alt="Globe with pin" style="width:100%">
            <p>Unlike most travel apps, in addition to merely providing a platform to plan and book trips, Pinboard also provides an exciting way to document all aspects of travel, from start to finish.</p>

        <div class="Challenge"></div>
            <h1>The Challenge</h1>
            <p> With the advent of more affordable and universally accessible travel solutions, a steadily increasing number of people have begun to embark on trips across the globe. As an avid traveller myself, I frequently use popular travel apps to research and plan upcoming trips. Unfortunately, although I am a self-proclaimed planning guru, my memories all tend to blend together when it comes time to recollect and share experiences from past trips. As such, when friends ask me for recommendations within places I have previously visited, I often find myself putting on my detective hat to comb through old photos in an effort to piece together where I stayed, what I ate, who I met, and what I saw during my visits. The logical solution to my problem, I concluded, would be a travel journal. However, remembering to carry around a physical journal from place to place seemed like a daunting and unrealistic task. Upon researching available apps, I realized that none existed which included features that I thought were essential, leading to the birth of Pinboard. Pinboard is an end-to-end mobile app designed to help adventurous users plan their travels, record their memories, and share their trips with friends.</p>

        <div class="Competitors">
                <h1>Competitor Analysis</h1>
                <h2>Google Maps</h2>
                <p> Upon voicing my frustrations to my peers, a friend suggested using Google Maps to record places visited during my travels. Although Google Maps provides an excellent way of starring visited restaurants and attractions within the section labelled “Your Places,” the app presents a distinct lack of customizable features. For example, Google Maps does not provide an option for users to add their personal photos, ratings, and notes to each individual attraction. Additionally, there is no clear way of grouping multi-city trips together while simultaneously maintaining any sort of separation between individual cities. Since travel is not the primary function of Google Maps, the app lacks basic features such as trip budgeting and expense reporting as well. </p>  
                <h2>Polarsteps</h2>
                <p>Next, I interviewed friends who had experience using Polarsteps, which unlike Google Maps, is an app specifically designed for documenting travel. However, much like with Google Maps, users expressed frustration with the limited trip personalization Polarsteps offers. For instance, Polarsteps only allows users to save a total of 5 restaurants and attractions per city visited. In addition, if a particular site is not listed within the app’s search engine, there is no way to manually input an entry. Although Polarsteps allows users to search for “spots and activities,” the app does not present any sort of rating system, making it difficult for users to plan and prioritize which places to visit. Some users also expressed confusion while trying to navigate various features of the app, indicating a heavy reliance on recall rather than recognition. Finally, Polarsteps fails to implement a system for documenting transportation, stays, and travel expenses. 
                </p>
                <p>After conducting user interviews and personally navigating travel apps with journaling systems in place, it was clear Pinboard needed to focus on the following features: </p>
            <div class="Features">
                    <p>1. A highly customizable user interface, allowing users to personalize each phase of their trip with photos, ratings, notes, and expenses</p>
                    <p>2. The ability to share entire trips or parts of trips with friends</p>
                    <p>3. An easily navigable and intuitive interface</p>

Because of their conflicting class schedules, Tessie can’t always travel with all of her friends. Often, Tessie ends up travelling to the same cities as her friends, but on a different timeline. In order to make solo travelling easier, Tessie and her friends usually exchange travel recommendations for places they have already visited. </p>
                        <p>Although she absolutely adores Madrid, Tessie misses her family back home in Minnesota. She never passes up an opportunity to share details about her trip with her mom, dad, and little sister, who always eagerly await stories of her adventures.

As Karan nears retirement, he seeks new adventures he can share with his family. Since he is self-employed, Karan can continue to conduct his business from anywhere around the world with a WiFi connection. Among his friends back home, Karan is constantly teased about missing family friend gatherings and dinners due to his borderline-nomadic lifestyle. Because he is so well known for being such a travel aficionado, Karan is constantly bombarded by requests from his friends for recommendations about everything, ranging from the best restaurants in each city to his favorite immersive cultural experiences. Unfortunately, because Karan still works while travelling, the stress from his job makes it difficult for him to keep track of the details of his many travels.

                        <p>In his college days, Karan took a series of photography courses. When he travels with his family, Karan never fails to utilize his photography skills to capture every moment with his kids. Although his phone is always filled with a nightmarish amount of photos, Karan wants to ensure he has plenty of memories with his family to cherish before his children graduate college and move away from home.

            <h1>Branding and the UI Design Process </h1>
            <p>After conducting user research and constructing a site map, I began working on designing the user interface for Pinboard. </p>
            <h2>The Evolution of Pinboard</h2>
            <p>When I was a child, my grandparents had an enormous world map plastered on their family room wall, with different colored pins in places they’d been and places they hoped to one day visit. Every time I visited, I would bombard my grandparents with a flurry of questions about their travels, while fervently flipping through their old photo albums from various trips. Although physical push pin maps are now perhaps a bit antiquated, Pinboard incorporates technological advancements to maintain a sense of nostalgia, while at the same time encouraging exploration.</p>
            <h2>Logo Iterations</h2>
            <p>The logo for Pinboard was intended to simultaneously convey a sense of adventure, sophistication, and connectivity. The network of arced lines in the final logo design represent the newfound proximity of various parts of the world brought about by technology, as well as the social networking aspect of Pinboard. The playful colors of the logo represent global diversity while alluding to the childlike curiosity often found in those who like to explore new places.</p>
            <div class="logoIterations">
                <div class="iteration">

            </div>
            <h2>The Demise of Pinboard </h2>
            <p>After designing a logo that perfectly represented the Pinboard brand, I turned my attention towards crafting a user interface consistent with the concept behind the app. Originally, I chose a dark-themed color palette with a standard bottom bar navigation.</p>
            <div class="darkTheme">
                    <div class="dark">
                        <img src="DarkPinboard.png" alt="Dark home" width="60%">
                    </div>
                    <div class="dark">
                        <img src="DarkPinned.png" alt= "Dark pinned" width="60%">
                    </div>
                    <div class="dark">
                            <img src="DarkTrip.png" alt= "Dark trip" width="60%">
                    </div>
            </div>
            <p>At first, I was satisfied with the simplicity and cleanliness of the UI. However, I soon realized the app had begun to stray from the intended nostalgia-evoking theme, and had instead taken take on an iOS-esque feel. Additionally, I was dissatisfied with the lack of adventure conveyed by app design. Finally, there was a clear inconsistency between the design of the logo and that of the app. In other words, the entire concept behind Pinboard was completely lost in translation. </p>
            <h2>The Revival of Pinboard</h2>
            <h3>Splash Page and Login</h3>
            <p>Pinboard’s splash page features the app’s logo with an animation to keep users entertained while the sign in screen loads. Before accessing any information on the app, users are prompted to either log in or create an account. Users also have the option of signing in with an already existing Google Plus, Facebook, or Twitter account. </p>
            <div class="splash">
                <video width="400" height="480" controls>
                        <source src="SplashPage.mp4" type="video/mp4">

                </video>
            </div>
            <h3>Navigation and Color Scheme</h3>
            <p>When redesigning the app, in order to maintain a consistent theme across the app, I decided to opt for a lighter color palette, drawing colors directly from the rainbow threads in the Pinboard logo. Since the previous iteration seemed exceedingly plain for a travel journal app, I focused on making the UI of the redesign more playful. In addition to revamping the color scheme of the app, I replaced the standard bottom bar navigation with a compass navigation. Swiping the compass as if spinning a wheel reveals a second set of icons. Although the “Home” and “Profile” icons give way to the “Explore” and “Friends” icons, the universal “Search” icon always points “North.” </p>
            <div class="splash">

            <h3>Pinned and Planned</h3>
            <p>From the “Profile” page, users can access their pinned and planned trips, represented by boarding pass stubs. “Pinned” refers to past visits, while “planned” refers to future trips. Pinned trips are indicated by polaroid pictures embedded with push pins, while the polaroids for planned trips are taped to represent their mutability.  </p>
            </div>
            <div class="darkTheme">

            </div>
            <p>Pinned and planned trips both provide users with the option of inputting food, stays, shopping, and experiences. Pinned trips allow users to add their own photos, write their own ratings, and add receipts for each experience, while planned trips link users to Tripadvisor ratings. In addition to the aforementioned features, pinned trips offer the option to input inter-city level transportation, trip level expenses, city level expenses, and notes. Planned trips offer the same features, but focus on pre-booked expenses. </p>

            <p>The friends page allows users to view their contacts “public” trips. Users have the ability to change the privacy settings of particular trips. Additionally, users can search their friend lists in order to share their trips with particular friends, or to create group trips. </p>

            <h1>Takeaways</h1>
            <p>Unlike other travel apps, Pinboard offers users a painless way of documenting travel, from the initial planning phases of user journeys, to adding photos and ratings while vacationing, to sharing experiences with friends after trips have already been pinned. Pinboard’s quirky user interface and highly customizable features ensure users never miss out on cherishing any of their travel memories, regardless of how unique they might be. </p>
