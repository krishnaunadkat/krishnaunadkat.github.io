            <p> Hello! I am Krishna, a recent graduate from Santa Clara University where I studied Biology and Computer Science. Despite my largely science academic background, I have always had a passion for design. After taking a Web Design class during my last quarter of college, although it was difficult for me to put Biology aside,  I realized my true interests lie in the UI/UX space. </p>
            <p> Outside of work and academics, I really enjoy drawing, painting, designing, sculpting, and am always looking to learn new forms of art. In my free time, I can constantly be found doodling on sheets of paper and embarking on new art projects. </p>
