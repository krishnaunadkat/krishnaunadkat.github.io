            <p> Hello! My name is Krishna. I’m a recent graduate from Santa Clara University. I'm passionate about the intersection of design and technology.  </p>
            <p> I studied Biology and Computer Science at school, but I’ve always loved design and I firmly believe that even the most advanced technology and scientific breakthroughs can be rendered useless by bad design. In an increasingly tech-filled world, I want to make computing more accessible, more personal, and more human.</p>
	    <p> Outside of work and academics, I really enjoy drawing, painting, designing, sculpting, and am always looking to learn new forms of art. In my free time, I can constantly be found doodling on sheets of paper and embarking on new art projects.</p>
