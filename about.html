            <p> Hello! My name is Krishna. I’m a recent graduate from Santa Clara University. I studied Biology and Computer Science at school, and I’ve always had a passion for design. After taking a Web Design class during my last quarter, I decided I wanted to dive deeper into the UI/UX space.  </p>
            <p> My academic background is heavily science based, but I firmly believe that even the best tech can be rendered useless by bad design. In an increasingly device-filled world, I am passionate about making technology more human.</p>
	    <p>Outside of work and academics, I really enjoy drawing, painting, designing, sculpting, and am always looking to learn new forms of art. In my free time, I can constantly be found doodling on sheets of paper and embarking on new art projects.</p>
