            <p> Hello! I am Krishna, a recent graduate from Santa Clara University where I studied Biology and Computer Science. Despite my largely science academic background, I have always had a passion for design. After taking a Web Design class during my last quarter of college, although it was difficult for me to put Biology aside,  I realized my true interests lie in the UI/UX space. </p>
            <p> Hello! My name is Krishna. I’m a recent graduate from Santa Clara University. I studied Biology and Computer Science at school, and I’ve always had a passion for design. After taking a Web Design class during my last quarter, I decided I wanted to dive deeper into the UI/UX space. 
My academic background is heavily science based, but I firmly believe that even the best tech can be rendered useless by bad design. In an increasingly device-filled world, I am passionate about making technology more human.
Outside of work and academics, I really enjoy drawing, painting, designing, sculpting, and am always looking to learn new forms of art. In my free time, I can constantly be found doodling on sheets of paper and embarking on new art projects.
